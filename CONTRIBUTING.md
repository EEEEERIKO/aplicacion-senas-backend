# Contributing to Backend

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This backend uses FastAPI and a simple flow:

- Branches: `develop` -> `test` -> `main` (push PRs to `test` to run tests)
- Use virtualenv, install requirements from `requirements.txt`
- Run tests: `pytest`

Please follow standard git flow and open PRs against `test` for CI validation.
